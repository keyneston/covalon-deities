What is clear is that their followers pursued physical improvement and discipline to defend, restrain, and heal. Seeking always to offer the wicked the option to forgo their previous ways, redemption of evil is held above its destruction. The most valued follower is one who once persecuted the Lotus.</p>\n<p><br /><strong>Edicts</strong> forgive those who have wronged you, seek redemption and encourage others to do the same, embrace balance<br /><strong>Anathema</strong> cause lethal harm to a living humanoid or beast, deny a repentant enemy the pursuit of redemption, encourage a non-combatant to fight, especially one who has retired from such a lifestyle<br /><strong>Follower Alignments</strong> LG, NG, CG, N</p>"
