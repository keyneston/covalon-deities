Indeed it seems that as long as there has been merrymaking he has been there to enjoy it, even the oldest of races tells storys of a bronze skinned man who exemplefies the life of the party. Oenos' following has never seemed powerful, or organized, though you would be hard pressed to find a tavern without his likeness somewhere. His teachings, of which there are many, center around being a gracious host and a grateful guest as has always been his way. These teachings seemingly passed down at random as priests encountered the god in varying states of drunkeness who only realized who had spoken it after they awoke the next day. This manner of divine intervention has always frustrated other more organized religions, some of which attribute the god to drunken hallucinations of innebriated priests and partygoers.</p>\n<p><br /><strong>Edicts</strong> drink, contribute to the party, give sanctuary and sustenance to any who ask in good faith<br /><strong>Anathema</strong> refuse the hungry or poor, waste food or alchohol, be rude or disruptive to the host.<br /><strong>Follower Alignments</strong> LG, NG, CG</p>"
