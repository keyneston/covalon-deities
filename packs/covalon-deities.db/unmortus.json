Long ago, in the beginnings of civilization, he was worshipped as a god of protection and the homeland and the protector of the heavens. He was restless and unyielding to his duty to the heavens, right until his unfortunate demise against a forgotten enemy. However, from his death, he rose again and kept his watch in unlife. Unfortunately, due to his new undead nature, his name fell into obscurity, with only a few nations knowing of him. Regardless, he keeps his vigil, even if the gods or mortals he protects despise him due to his nature.</p>\n<p>His followers pledge their soul to the defense of their nation, and connect it to the realm of the dead so that they can be risen in order to defend the nation long after they have perished. Sometimes called bone lords, death knights, or the living dead, they are often looked upon with mistrust and sometimes open antagonism. Stoically, they press onward. They work forever for their homeland, their every breath in service of its defense.</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> defend your homeland, improve your homeland, continue your duty by any means<br /><strong>Anathema</strong> abandon your nation, abandon your allies, disrespect your fallen comrades<br /><strong>Follower Alignments</strong> LG, LN, LE</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<h3>Devotee Benefits</h3>\n</div>\n<div class=\"item d-flex flex-wrap\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<div class=\"flex-even column\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<p class=\"hang\"><strong>Divine Font</strong> <em>harm</em> or <em>heal</em></p>\n<p class=\"hang\"><strong>Divine Skill</strong> Society</p>\n<p class=\"hang\"><strong>Favored Weapon</strong> bastard sword</p>\n<p class=\"hang\"><strong>Domains</strong> cities, protection, soul, undeath</p>\n<p class=\"hang\"><strong>Alternate Domain</strong> family</p>\n<p class=\"hang\"><strong>Cleric Spells</strong> 1st: <em>tether</em>, 2nd: <em>false life</em>, 5th: <em>wall of stone</em></p>\n</div>\n</div>"
