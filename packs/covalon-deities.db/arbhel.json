Arbhel is ruler of the Void brought some back to life to spread her influence through promises of the void cleansing the world and bringing it back to a pre-cataclysm state. Her true motivations remain unknown, but beware, for nothing good ever comes from the void.</p>\n<p><br /><strong>Edicts</strong> sow doubt amongst other gods' believers by spreading rumors or diminishing the power of their religions, guide souls to the void, attempt to discover the Catacylsm's cause<br /><strong>Anathema</strong> partake in other religions' customs, have children<br /><strong>Followers Alignments</strong> LE, N, NE, CE</p>"
