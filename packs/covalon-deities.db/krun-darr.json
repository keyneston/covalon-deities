      "value": "<p>Not a particularly well-known deity, Krun Darr is nevertheless deeply respected by those who know of them and admire their might. Their chosen form is remarkably variable, yet always reflects their own power, often versions of powerful creatures, but occasionally something less expected -- a stormcloud spanning the sky, an immense mechanical creation, or a mighty weapon built from metal. Regardless of their form, Krun Darr is invariably crackling with lightning and power, and tends to carry hints of blue and bronze coloring. This coloring has led to speculation of a connection to dragons and their deities, and indeed, both bronze and blue dragons are known to worship Krun Darr, while even those who do not worship them consider them a being who commands respect. Yet Krun Darr's origins and connections to other deities are still not fully understood. </p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> use your power to change the world around you, relish in the presence and sound of lightning, encourage those who change themselves<br /><strong>Anathema</strong> waste energy or effort, consider yourself or another restricted by their form<br /><strong>Follower Alignments</strong> NG, LN, N, CN, NE</p>"
