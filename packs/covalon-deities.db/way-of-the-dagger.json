However, none speak of the dagger users, those who have also reached the peakâ€¦ maybe it is that none have yet lived or that such persons have taken so fully to the path that their legacies are all but unknown. What lies at the end? A Dagger Demon or a Deity of Daggers? The minutest number dare tread this path, and few ever make it far.</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> seek perfection in the dagger; hone the body, mind, and spirit as the dagger: versatile, concealable, fast, and transitioning.<br /><strong>Anathema</strong> wield another weapon when a dagger is suitable, be without a dagger of one's own volition, deny yourself an advantage when proving the greatness of the dagger<br /><strong>Follower Alignments</strong> any</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<h3>Devotee Benefits</h3>\n</div>\n<div class=\"item d-flex flex-wrap\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<div class=\"flex-even column\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<p class=\"hang\"><strong>Divine Font</strong> <em>harm</em></p>\n<p class=\"hang\"><strong>Divine Skill</strong> Stealth</p>\n<p class=\"hang\"><strong>Favored Weapon</strong> dagger</p>\n<p class=\"hang\"><strong>Domains</strong> darkness, death, time, trickery</p>\n<p class=\"hang\"><strong>Cleric Spells</strong> 2nd: <em>invisibility</em>, 3rd: <em>haste</em>, 4th: <em>weapon storm</em></p>\n</div>\n</div>"
