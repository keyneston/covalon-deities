He is depicted as a massive worm, whose maw contains the upper body of a withered, dehydrated man. Hajra-Ikhut is said to wander the deserts, eternally in search of water to quench his thirst- unaware that in his wake he leaves a trail of water. <br />The Water Nomads 'follow' Hajra-Ikhut's path, for they see his passing in the presence of scattered oases and rare, blessed rainfall. He is a deity who demands little, but gives little in return- and this is how the Water Nomads prefer things.</p>\n<p><br /><strong>Edicts</strong> stay on the move, put the health of the tribe over your own, share water wherever you find it<br /><strong>Anathema</strong> allow yourself to grow complacent or sedentary, put yourself before the tribe, waste or destroy water<br /><strong>Follower Alignments</strong> N</p>"
